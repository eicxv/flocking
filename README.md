# flocking

This project is an implementation of the classic boid flocking algorithm.

## About

The [boid algorithm][reynolds-boids] was proposed by Craig Reynolds. A boid is a bird-like agent reacting to other nearby boids based on simple rules. In short each boid tries to move close to its neighbours, align itself with its neighbours and avoid collisions. Through these rules boids can display complex emergent flocking behaviour.

This project is built with [three.js][three].
